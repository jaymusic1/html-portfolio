<h3>The Lord of The Rings Trilogy</h3>

<p>Simply put the best movie adaptation of a book. 
It became a standard in the industry 
regarding to direction, film script and acting.</p>

<h3>The Shutter Island</h3>

<p>Another partnership between the director 
Martin Scorsese and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio. 
The plot is mindbreaking and both acting 
and direction are outstanding.</p>

<h3>Star Wars Original and Prequel Trilogies</h3>

<p>Another masterpiece, this one by George Lucas. 
    These films are major successes of the 
    entire cinema history.</p>
